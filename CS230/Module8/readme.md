# T*he Gaming Room Project*

## *Summary of the Client and Their Requirements*

*The Gaming Room wanted to expand their mobile game, ****"Draw It or Lose It"****, from Android to a web-based platform. The game involves teams guessing drawings to earn points. Key requirements included web compatibility, a large photo library, multiplayer functionality, and one-minute timed rounds.*

## *What Was Done Well*

*The business and technical constraints sections stood out as particularly strong. They clearly outlined the challenges of platform expansion and provided detailed solutions, such as ensuring user experience continuity during the transition to a web-based application and leveraging design patterns like Singleton and Iterator to meet the client’s needs effectively.*

## *Benefits of Using a Design Document*

*The design document made writing the application code much smoother. Making decisions in plain English helped clarify the goals and ensured they were well thought out before coding. This process minimized wasted time, as the objectives and solutions were concrete by the time development began.*

## *Potential Revisions*

*If I were to revise one part of the document, I would focus on the recommendations section. I would add a glossary for technical terms to help non-technical readers and ensure each recommendation briefly mentions how it aligns with the business and technical constraints to provide clearer context.*

## *Interpreting a*nd Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on their core requirements: expanding platform compatibility, maintaining familiar gameplay, and supporting multiplayer functionality. These needs were implemented through design choices like the Singleton and Iterator patterns to ensure smooth user management and consistent experiences across platforms. Considering user needs is crucial to create software that is practical, user-friendly, and aligns with client expectations, ensuring its success.

## Approach to Software Design

In the past, I focused primarily on writing code with minimal time spent on big-picture design. Using a design document shifted my approach by emphasizing planning and structure, especially with tools like UML diagrams. This experience taught me to prioritize design over coding in future projects, as revising plain English text and diagrams is much faster and more effective than reworking code.
